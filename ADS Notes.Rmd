#Week 1

Reproducible Data Analysis:
  - Want to establish practices that allow your work to be reproducible 
  
3 ways to do this:
  1. Set up project folder
  2. Documentation
  3. Project history and source control

Project Setup (given in starter repo):

  First identify a working folder that includes the following subfolders:
    - Data: data used in the analysis (READ ONLY)
    - Doc: the report or presentation file
    - Figs: Contains generated figures. Images for report go in doc folder
    - Lib: various files with function definitions and code
    - Output: analysis output, processed datasets, logs, or other processed things


#Week 2

Demo on two starter codes in repo project 1

In order to process data, just run Text_Processing.Rmd


```{r}



```
